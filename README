FabWiki is an extremely minimal wiki created by Jeff Warren (jeff@unterbahn.com) for collecting and archiving information about the Haystack FabLab, in the absence of web access.

Access it from any computer on the same local network (wifi hotspot) as the "Fab Mac 2" computer by going to the following address:

http://fabwiki.local:3000

The "Fab Mac 2" computer must be on, and connected to that network for the FabWiki to work; it's running on Fab Mac 2.

########################################
SOFTWARE

The FabWiki software is open source under the GNU GPL v2 and can be found in the Sites folder for the "fab" user on Fab Mac 2:

/Users/fab/Sites/fabwiki

########################################
BACKUP

From time to time, it's not a bad idea to back up the FabWiki by copying the above folder and emailing it to yourself or burying it on a USB key in the woods.

BUGS ETC

Just add bugs and issues and requests here, and occasionally email them to jeff@unterbahn.com, i guess:

* Example: Bug title: "blablabla can't do this, it all breaks"
